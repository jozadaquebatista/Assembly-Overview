# Assembly Language[ASM]

A time ago I've created some repos with code in JAVA, C/C++, JS, and so on, and I like it, and some people have learned from my simple codes, so now I had the ideia to create Assembly language repository, to help people understand better this AWESOME rich programming language.

# What motivates me to do this:
-> To learn more things
-> To help other people
-> To train my English
-> To learn microprocessors/microcontrollers architeture and mainly how low-level hardware works.



That's it, and I hope you like it! :)
