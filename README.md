# Assembly Language x86 n' x86_64 - ASM

<br>A time ago I've created some repos with code in JAVA, C/C++, JS, and so on, and I like it, and some people have learned from my simple codes, so now I had the ideia to create Assembly language repository, to help people understand better this AWESOME rich programming language.

# What motivates me to do this:
-> To learn more things<br>
-> To help other people<br>
-> To train my English<br>
-> To learn microprocessors/microcontrollers<br> architeture and mainly how low-level hardware works.<br><br><br>

## What do you need?<br>
-> NASM assembler(netwide assembler)<br>
-> NASM manual<br>
-> some good book or article about assembly programming language<br>
-> pacience and dedication<br><br>

That's it, and I hope you like it! :)
