# Assembly Language x86 n' x86_64 - ASM

<br>A time ago I've created some repos with code in JAVA, C/C++, JS, and so on, and I like it, and some people have learned from my simple codes, so now I had the ideia to create Assembly language repository, to help people understand better this AWESOME rich programming language.

# What motivates me to do this:
> To learn more things<br>
> To help other people<br>
> To train my English<br>
> To learn microprocessors/microcontrollers architeture<br> and mainly how low-level hardware works.<br><br>

## What do you need?<br>
> NASM assembler(netwide assembler)<br>
> NASM manual<br>
> some good book or article about assembly programming language<br>
> pacience and dedication<br><br>
