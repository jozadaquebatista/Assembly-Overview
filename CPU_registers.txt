In 32bits we has some main registers.

64 bits [ RAX     |    RBX    |    RCX    |    RDX   ]
32 bits [ EAX     |    EBX    |    ECX    |    EDX   ]
16 bits [ AX      |    BX     |    CX     |    DX    ]
08 bits [ AL,AH   |    BL,BL  |    CL,CH  |    DL,DH ] <--- each of these are 4 bits, and they must work together.
All of this registers are for:
..ACUMULATOR(RAX,EAX,AX)
..BASE(RBX,EBX,BX)
..COUNTER(RCX,ECX,CX)
..DATA(RDX,EDX,DX)

and segment register.

[ DS     |    CS    |    ES   |   SS   ], data segment, code segment, extra data segment, stack segment

and index registers.

[ SI, DI], source index, destination index

and STACK registers

[ SP, BP ], stack pointer, base pointer

[ IP ], holds the pointer to the next instruction.

[ EFLAGS ], contain a bunch of unrelated set of bits, that represent result of operations of microprocessor registors.
